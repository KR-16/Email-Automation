Email Assistant - Main Script
============================

This script is the main orchestrator for the Email Assistant system. It manages the processing
of emails for multiple candidates, coordinating between Excel data storage, Gmail operations,
and AI-powered email categorization and response generation.

The system:
1. Reads candidate information from Excel
2. Connects to each candidate's Gmail account
3. Processes today's emails
4. Categorizes emails using AI
5. Applies Gmail labels
6. Generates responses when needed
7. Tracks all activities in Excel
